<!-- I am a master student at [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/hui-xiong/). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from [School of Big Data and Software Engineering](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/), [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) in 2022. -->

Prior to this, I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Chongqing University in 2022.

My research interest focuses on Data Mining and Decision Intelligence, particularly in:

- Large Language Model, Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Network
- Social Computing, Combinatorial Optimization on Networking and FinTech

<!-- Foundational Methods: Large Language Model (LLM), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) -->
<!-- - Practical Applications -->
  <!-- - Intelligent Education, Networking Resource Management and Finance Technology -->



<!-- - Intelligent Education (Large Language Model and Agent)
- Networking Optimization (Resource Allocation and Scheduling)
- Finance Technology (Portfolio Management and Non-Fungible Token) -->


<!-- Large Language Model (Agent and Application in Education) -->

<!-- - Decision Intelligence (Portfolio and Resource Allocation) -->
<!-- Large Language Model (Agent and Application in Education) -->
