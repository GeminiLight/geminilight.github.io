I am a master student at [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/hui-xiong/). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from [School of Big Data and Software Engineering](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/), [ChongQiong University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests include

- Data Mining (Graph Mining and Reinforcement Learning)
- Large Language Model (Agent and Application in Education)
- Finance Technology (Non-Fungible Token and Portfolio)
- Networking Optimization (Resource Allocation and Scheduling)
